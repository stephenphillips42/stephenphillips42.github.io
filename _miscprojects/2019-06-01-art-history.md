Quite different from my other work, this is project was a collaboration with the Frick Museum of Art in New York and UPenn. A fairly open ended project, our group explored various ways computer vision could complement art history. I supervising numerous projects including:
* Master's Thesis: Automatic Hierarchical Art Categorization with Few Shot Categories
* Preprint: Learning Portrait Style Representations ([arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04153))
