Lab on a Chip, 13(21), 4231-4238.	2013-albumin-testing	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3810448/
2014	Cellphone microsphere fluorescence immunoassay for the detection of rbST biomarker in milk extracts	Protein biomarker-based screening for detection of recombinant bovine somatotropin abuse in dairy cows	We develop a method for detecting protien biomarkers in dairy cow milk on a cell phone. I developed the image processing algorithms to detect and count the biomarkers in the images.	Ludwig, S. K. J., Zhu, H., Phillips, S., Shiledar, A., Feng, S., & Tseng, D.
