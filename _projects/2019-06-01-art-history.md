A fairly recent project, this is a project in collaboration with the Frick Museum of Art in New York. It is fairly open ended, as long as the work is relevant and accurate to Art History and answers something interesting about image analysis or computer vision. Thus far I am working on or supervising projects for the following:
* Challenging Human Pose with Baroque and Renaissance Paintings (Supervising and Working on)
* Automatic Hierarchical Art Categorization with Few Shot Categories (Supervising and Working on)
* Style Disentanglement (Supervising)
