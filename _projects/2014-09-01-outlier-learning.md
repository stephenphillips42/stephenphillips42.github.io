My main thesis work, I am trying to learn motion and matching using deep learning and machine learning techniques. Previous work has used basic weight learning from error distributions (["Fast, robust, continuous monocular egomotion computation"](/publication/2016-01-01-Fast-robust)), learning motion representations using group properties as a loss ([Understanding image motion with group representations](/publication/2018-01-01-Understanding-image)), and learning sparse feature matching using cycle-consistency as a loss. Now I am working on extending the work to:
* Learn good representations for event-based cameras for tracking
* Explicitly incorporate outlier-rejection into a deep learning pipeline for pose-graph optimization and image feature matching
