### Course description
The [capstone course](https://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~meam620/wiki/) for the Robotics Masters program at the University of Pennsylvania. Helped TA this course for 3 separate years: 2016, 2018, and 2019. Covering a wide range of topics, this course teaches the basics of how to design the control and perception for an autonomous quadrotor. It is a heavily project based course. In 2019, I lectured for the majority of the perception based part. In all of the years, I helped design the homework for the perception part of the course, and also maintained the autograder for the projects (using my experience from [CIS 390: Planning and Perception](/teaching/planning-perception)). 

### Topics covered
#### Planning and Control
* Coordinate Frames and Transformations
* Kinematics, Dynamics for Quadrotors
* Basic Linear PD Controllers
* Non-linear controllers
* Graph Search, Dijkstras, A\*, Path Planning
* Trajectory Planning (and some optimization)
* Differential Flatness (for Quadrotors)
* Bayesian Filters: Kalman Filters, Extended Kalman Filters
#### Perception
* Camera Models, Camera Calibration 
* Projective Geometry, analysis and estimation from measurements
* Pose from Projective Geometry
* Procrustes
* Feature trackinga and Optical Flow
* Basic Outlier Rejection: RANSAC, and Hough Transform
* Motion Field Equations, linear and angular velocity estimation
* Essential Matrices
* Stereo, Multi-view Stereo
* 2 View Structure from Motion
