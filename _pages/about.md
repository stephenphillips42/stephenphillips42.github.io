I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at the Engineering Department at Swarthmore College. My research is on using machine learning for sensor fusion, with a focus on computer vision. I finished my PhD at the University of Pennsylvania studying under [Kostas Daniilidis](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/). Before coming to the University of Pennsylvania I studied at UCLA under [Stefano Soatto](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~soatto/).
