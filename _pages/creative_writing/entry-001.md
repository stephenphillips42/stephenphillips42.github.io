# Introduction to Creative Writing Project

This was made in collaboration with my sister, as she is very good about doing creative writing. 

## Why on your website?
I figured this would be the easiest way to share it. This link is on my github, obviously, but no one looks there, so while I can access this anywhere, it is unlikely anyone else will unless I tell them to. 

## Why creative writing?
I (like many others) have lots of story ideas in my head that I would think would be fun to write. However, writing is a skill and skills need practice, namely, I need practice if I want to tell those stories with any clarity. So this is an attempt to do that.

## OK - where do I go?

There should be a link to the next and previous entries at the bottom.
